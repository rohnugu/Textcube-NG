# Contributing to Textcube-NG

This is a community fork of [Textcube](https://github.com/Needlworks/Textcube).
Contributions are welcome, especially for the areas listed below.

## Priority Areas

- **Security hardening** — see open items in [SECURITY.md](./documents/SECURITY.md):
  - MD5 password hashing — intentionally retained for drop-in compatibility with existing Textcube
    data; any migration to `password_hash()` / `password_verify()` must include a careful rehashing
    strategy (e.g., on-login rehash) to avoid breaking existing user logins
  - Remaining raw SQL → prepared statement conversions
  - Cookie attribute hardening (`HttpOnly`, `SameSite`, `Secure`)
  - Bundled library CVE review (phpopenid, phpxpath, jpgraph)
- **Test coverage** — currently 33 tests in `tc_full_test.sh`; more scenarios welcome
- **Environment compatibility** — PostgreSQL, Nginx, MariaDB, IIS testing
- **Plugin and skin compatibility** — verification with existing Textcube plugins/skins
